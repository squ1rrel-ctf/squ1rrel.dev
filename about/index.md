squ1rrel is the competitive team of the Vanderbilt CTF Club.

A Capture the Flag (CTF) is a type of cybersecurity
competition where teams compete to solve challenges based on binary exploitation, reverse engineering, web exploitation, forensics, and cryptography to find a "flag" that gives them points.

This website also serves to house our writeups for interesting challenges we have solved, which should
give you a good idea of what sort of challenges to expect in a CTF.

We are also nationally and globally ranked, check out
our [CTFtime profile](https://ctftime.org/team/201730) to see our past performances.

### Invites

The club operates on an invite-only basis. We do not advertise or engage in outreach. This is intentional
to optimize for members who are both interested and willing. Seek out a current member if that sounds like you :)

If you are a Vanderbilt student, check out our [Anchor Link](https://anchorlink.vanderbilt.edu/organization/vandyctf).

We do not look for previous experience in CTFs, only a willingness to put in the time and a desire to learn.
By regularly participating in CTFs with the team, you will pick up a lot of what goes into solving challenges while
hanging out with some of the smartest people at Vanderbilt and having fun in the process.
