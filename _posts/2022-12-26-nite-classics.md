Paging Nick Gebo - Get Your Ass In Here

We start with a PCAP file. Let's throw it in Wireshark:

We can start by taking a look at the protocol hierarchy.

It's all TCP, so let's go ahead and follow the TCP stream. For the sake of convenience, we'll only look at the server response.

Scrolling to the bottom, we find most of the flag. We can definitely see the start, and that seems like the end too, but it looks like there's some more information in the middle there. There are some clear patterns, but no indication of how we might decode it. Luckily, we know one other piece of information:

"RS Cube" and "This is an MC Classic server written in Rust" are [enough to help us find the code for the server.](https://github.com/Skryptonyte/RSCube) Using this, we can spin up our own instance of the server, provide the client input to it, and see what sort of response we get.

We can see that all of that junk in the middle was actually block placements. Now we're getting somewhere interesting. We can reformat that data into commands, then open up Minecraft and run them. Doing that, we get this:

That's ... something. It seems like it could maybe be our missing section if we clean it up a bit. So I did a little bit of mining off camera, and now we have this:

That gives us the middle part of the flag, and now we can put all the parts together to get the solution.
