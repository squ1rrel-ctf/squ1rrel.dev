A two-part CTF challenge!

## Step 1: The Problem

This question is a double problem, with the same file giving us the flag for two different CTF challenges. The file is called `Assignment-broken.xps`.

The first question was Broken Converter, which had the following prompt:

> Miku has finally finished her assignment and is ready to submit it – but for some reason, the school requires all assignments to be submitted as .xps files. 
> Miku found a converter online and used the converted file for submission.
> The file looked good at first, but it seems as if there’s something broken in the converter. Can you help her figure out what is wrong?

The second question was flag Mono, which had this prompt:

> When writing the assignment, Miku used a font called flag Mono.
> Despite it looking just like a regular monospaced font, it claims itself to be “stylistic” in various ways.
> 
> "Perhaps there’s something special about it", Miku thought.

## Step 2: Initial Steps

To start off, we're given a `Assignment-broken.xps` file.

With some searching we figured out that XPS stands for "Open XML Paper Specification," which is similar to a .pdf file. To open it on a Windows Computer, we can use the reader that Microsoft provides for us in Settings -> Apps -> Optional Features -> XPS Viewer.

After opening up the file, we saw looks something like this:

![XPS File](/assets/sekai/agarg-usa/xpsfile.webp)

With some searching, we figured out that the XPS file format is just a zip file in disguise (like how a .jar file is just a .zip file). So we can change the extension of the file and then extract it.

Once we extracted it we got this file structure:

```
├── Documents
│   └── 1
│       ├── FixedDoc.fdoc
│       └── Pages
│           ├── 1.fpage
│           └── _rels
│               └── 1.fpage.rels
├── FixedDocSeq.fdseq
├── Resources
│   └── 02F30FAD-6532-20AE-4344-5621D614A033.odttf
├── [Content_Types].xml
├── _rels
└── docProps
    ├── core.xml
    └── thumbnail.jpeg
```

## Step 3: Making Sense of the Files

When we were playing around with the file, we tried copy-pasting the file contents into another file. When doing this, we saw that the copied contents didn't at all match the content we saw when viewing the file.

Instead of Lorem Ipsum Dolar ..., we get:

```

```

Hmm... Interesting. It seems like the font is messed up, and the symbols for each character do not correspond to what we think they should (ex. it seems 2 goes to L, s to o, etc).

Looking back at the File Tree Directory we saw from earlier, it seems like the `Documents/` directory is the file dir for every single page in the document. _rels, FixedDocSeq.fdseq and \[Content_Types].xml seem to contain some property .xml files and then the docProps file gives us a thumbnail for the document.

The most interesting file here was `02F30FAD-6532-20AE-4344-5621D614A033.odttf`, and with a quick google search, we found out that it was some sort of font file. Only thing is that it seems to be obfuscated, with the decryption key being somehow hidden inside the name of the file (`02F30FAD-6532-20AE-4344-5621D614A033`).

On Google, I was able to find a converter script to turn our obfuscated `odtff` font file into a more widely used `tff` file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Credit to https://gist.github.com/dungsaga/ab8d2379bb566c9925b27df3bc82ca8b

import os
import sys

fn_in = sys.argv[1]
fn_out = os.path.splitext(sys.argv[1])[0] + '.ttf'
print(fn_out)
# Parse
key = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(fn_in))[0].replace('-', '')
# Convert to Int reversed
key_int = [int(key[i-2:i], 16) for i in range(32, 0, -2)]

with open(fn_in, 'rb') as fh_in, open(fn_out, 'wb') as fh_out:
    cont = fh_in.read()
    fh_out.write(bytes(b ^ key_int[i % len(key_int)] for i, b in enumerate(cont[:32])))
    fh_out.write(cont[32:])
```

Running this script with the command `python3 odtff_to_tff.py 02F30FAD-6532-20AE-4344-5621D614A033.odtff`, we get a .tff file. Bingo.

## Step 4: Playing With our Font File

To further investigate our `.tff` file, I used a font viewer I found online called [FontDrop](https://fontdrop.info/#/?darkmode=true).

Dragging in our `tff` file, we can immediately find our first flag.

![glyphs of our odtff file](/assets/sekai/agarg-usa/odtffglyphs.webp)

Bingo: Flag 1 is `SEKAI{sCR4MBLed_a5ci1-FONT+GlYPHZ,W3|!.d0n&}`.
It seems like for this flag, they just moved around the standard glyphs of ~!@#$%^&*()_+`1234567890-= ... to make the flag.

For our second flag, we can again use this viewer to help us.
If we try enabling different OpenType features (which in normal fonts are used when trying to type out different ligatures/font variants), we can get our next flag.

Here, the word "flag" is turned into different parts of the flag when different OpenType features/ligatures are enabled.

And there's our second flag: `SEKAI{OpenTypeMagicGSUBIsTuringComplete}`.
