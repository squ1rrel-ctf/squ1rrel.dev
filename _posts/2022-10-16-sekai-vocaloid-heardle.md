Well, it’s just too usual to hide a flag in stegano, database, cipher, or server. What if we decide to sing it out instead?

## Files Provided

1. `vocaloid_heardle.py`
2. `flag.mp3`

## Step 1: How the flag is generated

After looking at the files, it became clear that `vocaloid_heardly.py` is the file used to generate `flag.mp3`:

Let's imagine that the flag is `SEKAI{THIS_IS_MY_FIRST_WRITEUP}`. Given this flag, the python script:

1. Removes the enclosing `SEKAI{...}` to get the inner substring `THIS_IS_MY_FIRST_WRITEUP`.

2. Converts each character to unicode:
   ```py
   ord('T') -> 84
   ord('H') -> 72
   ord('I') -> 73
   ...
   ```

3. Gets all musics with musicId equal to the characters' unicodes and downloads it, storing them into the array `tracks`:
    ```py
    print()
    # returns a random assetbundleName from the list of all musics
    # with musicId equals to the given input mid
    def get_resource(mid):
        choice = random.choice([i for i in resources if i["musicId"] == mid])
        return choice["assetbundleName"]

    def download(mid):
        resource = get_resource(mid)
        r = requests.get("https://storage.sekai.best/sekai-assets/" + \
                f"music/short/{resource}_rip/{resource}_short.mp3")
        filename = f"tracks/{mid}.mp3"
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(r.content)
        return mid

    tracks = [download(ord(i)) for i in flag]

    # here is how tracks look like after execution:
    # tracks = [
    #   'vs_0084_01',       --> musicId = 84 ('T')
    #   '0072_01',          --> musicId = 72 ('H')
    #   'se_0073_01'        --> musicId = 73 ('I')
    #   ...
    # ]
    ```

4. Stitches together the given music files using `ffmpeg` to generate `flag.mp3`:
    ```python
    # stage 1
    inputs = sum([["-i", f"tracks/{i}.mp3"] for i in tracks], [])
    # stage 2
    filters = "".join(f"[{i}:a]atrim=end=3,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a{i}];" 
                            for i in range(len(tracks))) + \
              "".join(f"[a{i}]" for i in range(len(tracks))) + \
              f"concat=n={len(tracks)}:v=0:a=1[a]"
    # stage 3
    subprocess.run(["ffmpeg"] + inputs + 
        ["-filter_complex", filters, "-map", "[a]", "flag.mp3"])

    # stage 1:
    # inputs = [
    #   '-i', 'tracks/vs_0084_01.mp3',
    #   '-i', 'tracks/0071_01.mp3',
    #   '-i', 'tracks/se_0073_01.mp3',
    #   ...
    # ]

    # stage 2:
    # filters = '[0:a]atrim=end=3,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a0];
    # [1:a]atrim=end=3,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a1];
    # [2:a]atrim=end=3,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a2]; ...'

    # stage 3:
    # ffmpeg -i tracks/vs_0084_01.mp3 -i ... 
    # -filter_complex <filters> -map [a] flag.mp3
    ```


## Step 2: Reversing the code

Having understood how the flag is generated, the obvious next step is to somehow figure out (1) which music files make up `flag.mp3`, (2) get the corresponding musicIds from the file names, and (3) convert the musicIds from unicode to ASCII.

### 2.1 Understand how FFMPEG works

I needed to Google a bit to figure out what the `ffmpeg` instruction was doing specifically.

I stumbled upon a [stackoverflow post](https://superuser.com/a/1121879) that teaches us to concatenate two audio files via `ffmpeg`'s `filter_complex`.

Here is a visualization of how `ffmpeg` commands work for the above example:

![how ffmpeg works](https://imgur.com/DzH6fHq.png)

`ffmpeg` accepts some input files via the `-i` option, then performs a series of filters via the `-filter_complex` option (which are separated by semicolons), and finally outputs & saves the final output stream `[a]` as `flag.mp3`.

You can learn more about how `ffmpeg` works [here](https://www.opensourceforu.com/2015/04/get-friendly-with-ffmpeg).

Diving deeper into `filter_complex`, I learned what the [atrim](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#atrim) and [asetpts](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#setpts_002c-asetpts) filters do in stage 2:

> "atrim=end=3" will stop trimming at 3 seconds
> "asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS" will specify to start at the first frame

Thus, stage 2 is essentially trimming the first 3 seconds of all the audio files and concatenating them together in the order of input:

```python
# stage 2
filters = "".join(f"[{i}:a]atrim=end=3,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a{i}];" for i in range(len(tracks))) + \
      "".join(f"[a{i}]" for i in range(len(tracks))) + \
      f"concat=n={len(tracks)}:v=0:a=1[a]"
```

A quick sanity check confirms that our hypothesis is true: `flag.mp3` is an audio file that lasts for 33 seconds (multiple of 3), and while playing the audio file we learn that every 3 seconds the music changes.

Thus, the inner substring of the flag must contain 33 / 3 = 11 characters!

### 2.2 When life gives you ffmpeg, make a bunch of audio files

Why not immediately make use of all the knowledge we've learned about `ffmpeg`?

A quick google search taught me [how to split an audio file into equal segments](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280767/how-do-i-split-an-audio-file-into-multiple) using `ffmpeg`:

```
ffmpeg -i flag.mp3 -f segment -segment_time 3 -c copy flag_char_%03d.mp3
```

This generated precisely 11 files:

```
📂 vocaloid_heardle
┣ 🎵 flag.mp3
┣ 🐍 vocaloid_heardle.py
┗ 📂 flag_chars
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_000.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_001.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_002.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_003.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_004.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_005.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_006.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_007.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_008.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 flag_char_009.mp3
  ┗ 🎵 flag_char_010.mp3
```

### 2.3 The end justifies the means

One hour into the challenge and I was determined to solve this CTF. My teammates probably got tired of hearing me repeatedly play `flag.mp3`. It is about time for me to tell them "I found the flag!!"

Okay, we got the individual audio files. Now we need to know which musicId each of the `flag_char_XXX.mp3` corresponds to.

~~What's the most algorithmically efficient way to do that?~~

Brute force. Brute force is the way.

And so that's what I did: I scraped and downloaded all 638 music files (>500MB) provided by `resources.json`:

```python
# get all possible resourceID from resources.josn
def scrape():
    with open("resources.json", "r") as f:
        resources = json.load(f)

    # download all possible assetBundleNames
    for resource in resources:
        ass = resource["assetbundleName"]
        print("getting asset:", ass)
        r = requests.get(f"https://storage.sekai.best/sekai-assets/music/short/{ass}_rip/{ass}_short.mp3")

        # write to a new file
        filename = f"tracks/{ass}.mp3"
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(r.content)
        print(f"wrote to file: tracks/{ass}.mp3")

# sit and wait
scrape()
```

Now my folder looks like this:

```
📂 vocaloid_heardle
┣ 🎵 flag.mp3
┣ 🐍 vocaloid_heardle.py
┣ 📂 flag_chars
┃ ┣ 🎵 flag_char_000.mp3
┃ ┣ 🎵 flag_char_001.mp3
┃ ┗ ...
┗ 📂 tracks             # 638 MP3s (>500MB)
  ┣ 🎵 0001_01.mp3
  ┣ 🎵 0002_01.mp3
  ┗ ...
```

Here comes the hard part: figuring out which audio file maps to each of the `flag_char_XXX.mp3`.

**Attempt 1:** I tried using python difflib's [SequenceMatcher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html), but was not able to find matching audio files. My guess is that while performing `ffmpeg` the sequence of bytes may not necessarily align perfectly.

```python
# DID NOT WORK
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def compare():
    # loop through all track files
    with open("resources.json", "r") as f:
        resources = json.load(f)

    for resource in resources:
        ass = resource["assetbundleName"]
        # use ffmpeg to compare file with all 12 flags

def similar(a, b):
    return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()

def brute_force_flag_char(file_name):
    file_to_brute = open(file_name, "rb").read()
    # loop through all track files
    with open("resources.json", "r") as f:
        resources = json.load(f)

    for resource in resources:
        ass = resource["assetbundleName"]
        # use ffmpeg to compare file with all 12 flags
        file2 = open(f"trim_tracks_mp3/{ass}_3s.wav", "rb").read()
        sim_ratio = similar(file_to_brute, file2)
        if sim_ratio > 0:
            print(f"{sim_ratio}: {ass}")

# sit and wait
for i in range(11):
    brute_force_flag_char(f"flags/flag_char_{i:03}.mp3")
```

**Attempt 2:** I then tried using [audiodiff](https://github.com/SteveClement/audiodiff), but again it didn't work.

At this point I felt defeated.

Maybe I implemented someting incorrectly...

### Step 3: Stumbling upon gold

Then, after some more Googling, I found this: [Sononym](https://www.sononym.net/)

It is a free software that allows you to find similar sounding samples in a sample collection with simple drag-and-drop UI:

![Demo of Sononym Similarity Search](https://www.sononym.net/img/docs/similarity-search-mode.png)

I downloaded the software. Dragged my `tracks` folder containing 638 audio files into the app. Then dragged `flag_char_000.mp3` in as well.

Lo and behold, an instant 99% match on `vs_0118_01.mp3` which corresponds to `musicId: 118` or `chr(118)` which is the letter `v`!

### Step 4: Getting the flag

Now quickly repeat this for all 11 characters:

| flag characters   | musicId files   | unicode | ascii |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------- | ----- |
| flag_char_000.mp3 | vs_0118_01.mp3  | 118     | v     |
| flag_char_001.mp3 | 0048_01.mp3     | 48      | 0     |
| flag_char_002.mp3 | 0067_01.mp3     | 67      | C     |
| flag_char_003.mp3 | vs_0097_01.mp3  | 97      | a     |
| flag_char_004.mp3 | vs_0108_01.mp3  | 108     | l     |
| flag_char_005.mp3 | vs_0111_01.mp3  | 111     | o     |
| flag_char_006.mp3 | 0073_01.mp3     | 73      | I     |
| flag_char_007.mp3 | vs_0100_01.mp3  | 100     | d     |
| flag_char_008.mp3 | 0060_01.mp3     | 60      | <     |
| flag_char_009.mp3 | vs_0051_01.mp3  | 51      | 3     |
| flag_char_010.mp3 | vs_0117_01 .mp3 | 117     | u     |

And at last, the flag has been found: `SEKAI{v0CaloId<3u}`

The end must justify the means.
